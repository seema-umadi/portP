	-Find the IDs of the commits you want to merge.Open your Git repository in a terminal or command prompt.Type git rebase -i HEAD~n and hit Enter. 
	-Replace n with the number of commits you want to merge plus one.A list of commits will appear in a text file.	-Change the word "pick" to "squash" or just "s" in front of ever  	 commit except the first one.Save the file and close it.
	-You'll be asked to write a new message for the merged commit.
	-Write your message, save, and close the editor.Git will create a new commit that combines all the changes from the merged commits.
	
2) What is git diff?
	- diff is a command-line utility that allows you to compare two files line by line. It can also compare the contents of directories.

3) How can we drop multiple indexing file in stash?
	If you want to delete stash 1 to 3,just go to shell and type the following command:
	for n in {1..3}
	do
	git stash drop stash@{1}   
	done
	-Deletion of all stashes is done using the 'git stash clear' command. A specific stash can be removed by using the 'git stash drop stash@{0}' command.

4) Branching strategies workflow.
	- Branches are primarily used as a means for teams to develop features giving them a separate workspace for their code. These branches are usually merged back to a master branch upon 	  completion of work. In this way, features (and any bug and bug fixes) are kept apart from each other allowing you to fix mistakes more easily. 
	-for that we need to create a seprate branch, once you created a seprate branch for developers. Then existing branch data will copy automatically into new branch, those new branch 	 called as a featured branch.
	-each task has a seprate branch. After done with the code in feature branch need -> commit -> merge with master. this concept is useful for parallel development.
